TechCraft
=========

A resulting cross of technology and magic

This source code is part of the unreleased TechnoCraft Mod. 

This mod is designed to be a jack of all trades dabbling in farming ore production and any other thing that people can give me ideas on.

The over all goal of this mod is to make processes take less time.

	Examples
	
		-The Furnace uses more fuel but smelts items instantly.

Current Ideas to Build On

Current Bugs
